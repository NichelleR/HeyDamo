            <p>Adamo Lorenzo Devigili, I have loved you for a very long time. I can remember our days in middle 
              school being 'girlfriend/boyfriend', but that doesn't even come close to the feelings that I have developed
              for you over the last decade now. Through the ups and downs you have always been my person and I cannot thank you 
              enough for that.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Damo, I love you so much words can't even describe it.
              So, instead of trying to come up with the words right now, I'm gonna let all 
              our messages do the talking for me.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h4>Combined incomes may lead to a better mortgage rate</h4>
              <p>Being married gives you more flexibility and that’s the name of the game when you’re trying to getting a better mortgage rate and/or trying to apply for a larger loan.
                <br><br>
                You’ll want to get a joint mortgage which is a mortgage that you both share together. Why? Because lenders will consider both of your incomes. Two incomes are bound to be higher than one, and the larger total income will often qualify you for a bigger loan with better repayment terms than you could get on your own.

              <p>With auto insurance, whether you’re purchasing a policy or hoping for a lower rate on an existing policy, see what deals are available for married couples because studies now point to the fact that married people are getting better auto insurance rates. Period. 
                <br><br>
                With home insurance, most companies just give a flat-out-discount if you’re married. Here again, the bottom line is that couples get this type of automatic discount.</p>
